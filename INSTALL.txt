This file is just a basic queue implementation to show you how to start
using this queue system

First of all, go to admin/config/system/aws-queue and configure your
AWS credentials.

These credentials can be found at https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials
under Access Keys

If you want to replace all Drupal queue systems with the amazon queue you can
check the checkbox in the admin page but this is not required.

See code snippet in the README.txt on how to use this module.
